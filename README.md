## 📋 Requirements
OptiFine is **not** required for this resource pack to work. Only versions of Minecraft starting from 1.6 and above, no versions before 1.6 will work since texture animations were added in Minecraft 1.6.

For versions 1.4 and above, the [Continuity](https://modrinth.com/mod/continuity) or [OptiFine](https://www.optifine.net/) mod is needed **only** for emissive textures.

## 📃 Information on other Resource Packs
If you are using resource packs that change the textures of any of the ones that this one changes (view the list called "Items with an Animation" above), they will **not** be compatible since one will overlap the other. So that means that it's either you use custom textures without animations, or animations without custom textures.
